# 🧭 Hamiltonian Cycle Visualizer

This Python script finds a **Hamiltonian Cycle** in a user-provided undirected graph using **Backtracking**. It also **visualizes the step-by-step traversal** using `networkx` and `matplotlib`.

## 📌 Features

- Accepts input as an **adjacency matrix**.
- Uses **backtracking** to find a Hamiltonian cycle (if it exists).
- **Visualizes** the progress of the search step-by-step.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install matplotlib networkx

📈 Output
Prints the Hamiltonian Cycle if found.

Shows a step-by-step graph visualization of the search process.
